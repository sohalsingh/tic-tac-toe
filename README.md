# tic-tac-toe

Certainly! Here's an example README file explaining the working of the Tic Tac Toe game project:

This is a simple text-based implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It allows two players to play the game on the command line.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `tictactoe.py`.
2. The board will be displayed, and the game will prompt the current player to make a move.
3. Enter the row number (0-2) and column number (0-2) where you want to place your symbol (X or O).
4. The game will validate the move and update the board accordingly.
5. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
6. The winning player or a tie will be announced, and the final board will be displayed.
